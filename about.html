<h1>About this project</h1>
<p>
	My name is Pedro Ha. I've been living in JS-land and front-end for the last 6 years. I worked on large-scale websites like bn.com and cnbc.com.

	I taught adults at NYU and FIT, and children through Coderdojo and Nano Hacker Squad at Thoughtworks.
</p>

<p>
	The bulk of the work for green screening is provided by the library <a href="http://seriouslyjs.com/"><em>Seriously.js</em></a> by <a href="http://chirls.com/">Brian Chirls</a>.

<p>
	Green screening is dedicated to the loving memory of Susanita, Angelica and Michelle, who passed away in a car tragedy.
